# Eat-Da-Burger
Burger SQL Homework

## What is Eat-Da-Burger?

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

### Challenges and Lessons learned

The challenge in this project was on how to be able to use handlebars and ORM together it becaming tough to be able to keep things organized and intertwined while keeping code readability as best as possible. It took a lot of patience and drawing out but at the end of the day I believe I  maintained good project layout and readability of course I will get better with time and I feel im on the right step
